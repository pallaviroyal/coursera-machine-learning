Machine Learning course given by Andrew Ng from Stanford University

## Machine Learning 

Giving human experience to machine in the form of data, let machine to learn from the data which we have given and perform the task and measure the performance. Loop this process untill machine can get a intelligence to perform given task as a human. - my words 

A computer program said to be learn from experience E with respective to class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. - Tom Mitchell 

```
Checkers game : 

E - The experience of playing many games of checkers.
T - The task of playing checkers.
P - The probability that the game will win the next game.
```


Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn, without being explicitly programmed - Andrew Ng.  

Example :: 

* Each time, when doing web search that works so well because their machine learning software has figureout ranked web pages.
* Machine identifying the email spam because machine got learn from spam & non-spam emails.
* Facebook recognize our friends in photos, also machine learning.

In general any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications
 - Supervised Learning
 - Unsupervised Learning
## Supervised Learning 

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output. 

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.
